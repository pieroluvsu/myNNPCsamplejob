            <p>will help solve its petroleum importation challenge. And it hopes for more: amid fears of oil glut as nations move to cleaner energy, Nigeria will still be able to sell to the privately-owned refiner for at least 20 years. </p>
            <p>To do this, the government has locked down a right-of-first-refusal agreement with the company, with Nigeria owning 20 per cent of the firm. </p>
            <p>The Group Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited, Mele Kyari, said this on Tuesday in Abuja. He said Nigeria will stop importing refined fuel by mid of 2023. </p>
            <p>He said the combination of output from the Dangote Refinery, which is scheduled to begin next year, would help “eliminate any importation of petroleum products into the country in the mid of 2023.” </p>
            <p>“Even if all our four refineries in three locations are operating at 90 per cent of installed capacity, they will only be able to raise 18 million litres of petrol,” he said. </p>
            <p>That means that “even if all of them are working today, you would still have a net deficit of PMS to import into this country.” </p>
